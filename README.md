# Social Network Analysis in R

This project uses the `igraph` package in R to perform Social Network Analysis (SNA), focusing on network creation, visualization, and analysis. It is intended as a learning project to improve skills in R.

## Features
- Create and plot directed and undirected graphs.
- Calculate network metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, etc.).
- Visualize networks with various layouts and node properties.
- Analyze real-world network data from a CSV file.
- Detect communities in the network.

## How to Use
1. **Install the required package**:
   ```r
   install.packages("igraph")

Graph Visualization: Multiple layouts and node highlighting based on degree.

Network Measures: Degree, closeness, betweenness, hubs, and authorities.

Community Detection: Using edge betweenness clustering.
